# NPLAM
This is a Tensorflow implementation of the paper: Neural Partially Linear Additive Model. 

## Requirements
The model is implemented using Python3.7 with dependencies specified in requirements.txt.
## Data Preparation

### Simulation datasets
All simulation dataset are generated by creatdata.py.

### Real-world datasets
Download the California Housing dataset and Boston Housing dataset from [https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~ltorgo/Regression/cal_housing.html](https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~ltorgo/Regression/cal_housing.html) and [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/]( https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/), respectively. Move them into the data folder.

### Read dataset
All data can be loaded from "datasets".
"read_data.py" can read the data and divide this dataset into training set, validation set and test set.

## Model Structure

### Layer and Model

* The layers of the NPLAM are shown in the layer.py.

* The model of the NPLAM are shown in the model.py.

## Get the result
* result.py and run.py are the main files for running NPLAM.
